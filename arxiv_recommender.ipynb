    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This study develops a content-based recommender system designed to navigate the expansive and intricate domain of academic publications on the arXiv platform. Utilizing semantic embeddings, this system aims to precisely match researchers with papers that align closely with their interests or current research queries, leveraging the nuanced semantic relationships within academic texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process commenced with meticulous data preparation, involving the cleaning and preprocessing of text data to optimize it for processing by a Sentence Transformer. This step was crucial to ensure the quality and relevance of the semantic embeddings generated, which serve as the foundation of our recommendation logic. By encoding the abstracts or titles into dense vector representations, we captured the inherent semantic information of each paper, facilitating a nuanced comparison of their content.\n",
    "We explored various algorithms to structure and interpret these embeddings effectively. Starting with a basic approach that directly utilized embeddings for recommendations, we advanced to more sophisticated clustering techniques: KMeans and HDBSCAN, each offering unique advantages in grouping semantically similar papers. To further enhance our model, we integrated HDBSCAN with UMAP, a dimensionality reduction technique, to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data and to refine our clustering outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of the models' effectiveness was comprehensive, employing a series of statistical tests to discern the most proficient method. This included evaluating the models based on normalized hit scores derived from the 'terms' labels of the query and recommended papers, and further statistical comparisons through non-parametric tests to ascertain significant differences among the models. The absence of true labels necessitated a creative approach to evaluation, leading us to utilize metrics such as the Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) and Kendall's Tau for a nuanced assessment of model performance.\n",
    "Statistical tests, including T-tests, Mann-Whitney U, Friedman, Nemenyi, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, were utilized to compare model performances. These tests provided insights into each model's effectiveness, highlighting KMeans as the most effective in semantic clustering, followed by the combined use of HDBSCAN and UMAP. The analysis underscored the significance of hyperparameter tuning, especially for models like HDBSCAN, and demonstrated the utility of UMAP in managing high-dimensional embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study contributes to the field of information retrieval by showcasing a methodology for leveraging semantic embeddings in clustering and recommending academic papers. It highlights the potential of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in improving the accessibility of relevant literature within extensive datasets like arXiv. This approach offers a scalable solution to the challenge of navigating large-scale academic repositories, providing a foundation for future enhancements in recommender system design.\n"

    "We are interested in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of terms (or labels) in a DataFrame column named 'terms', commonly associated with academic or research articles. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution and relationship of terms within a dataset. This EDA is particularly valuable for our arXiv dataset ofpublications, where terms represent subjects, methodologies, or technologies addressed in the articles.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you analyse functions in 'eda.py' you will find that the terms_statistics function begins by ensuring that each entry in the 'terms' column is correctly formatted as a list, even if it was stored as a string representation of a list. This step is vital for consistent data processing. It then proceeds to split and flatten the terms, accounting for terms that might be separated by semicolons or commas, ensuring a uniform representation of each term across the dataset. This preprocessing enables accurate counting and analysis of term occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Counter library is utilized to count the occurrences of each term, highlighting the number of unique terms, the terms that appear only once (potentially indicating niche topics or incorrect tags), and the most common labels. This analysis provides insights into the dataset's focus areas and the distribution of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard_terms function visualizes this analysis through a series of plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top 40 Most Frequent Terms: A bar plot showcasing the terms with the highest occurrence, offering a visual representation of the dataset's dominant topics.\n",
    "- Venn Diagram of Top 3 Labels: This diagram visualizes the overlap between the datasets' three most common terms, providing insight into interdisciplinary topics or common combinations of labels.\n",
    "- Top 20 Primary Categories for 'cs.CV': Through a bar plot, it highlights the primary categories associated with Computer Vision papers, revealing the diversity of subtopics under a major category.\n",
    "- Pareto Plot of Primary Categories: A bar plot accompanied by a line plot illustrating the cumulative percentage, this plot identifies the 'vital few' primary categories that constitute the majority of the dataset, following the Pareto principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA is aimed at uncovering the underlying structure of terms within the dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dataset's thematic focus and guiding further research, data cleaning, or machine learning model development. By visualizing the frequency and relationships of terms, we can identify areas ripe for investigation, collaboration opportunities, or gaps in the literature. Moreover, this analysis can help in refining the dataset for training recommendation systems or classification models by highlighting the terms that significantly contribute to the dataset's informational value."

    "The provided image appears to be a collection of visualizations representing the distribution of labels (or \"terms\") across a dataset of academic papers, with a focus on terms related to computer science, particularly 'cs.CV' (Computer Vision), 'cs.LG' (Machine Learning), and 'stat.ML' (Statistical Machine Learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Top 40 Most Frequent Terms Bar Plot: This plot shows that 'cs.CV' is the most common label, followed by 'cs.LG' and 'stat.ML'. This indicates that computer vision and machine learning are dominant subjects in the dataset, suggesting that a recommender system for academic papers might be biased towards these topics.\n",
    "**Impact on Recommender System:** Papers with these labels are likely to be recommended more often, simply due to their prevalence in the dataset. This could create a bias where newer or less common research areas are less likely to be recommended, even if they are more relevant to a user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Venn Diagram of Top 3 Labels: The Venn diagram shows significant overlap between 'cs.CV' and 'cs.LG', and to a lesser extent with 'stat.ML'. This suggests a high degree of interdisciplinary research between these fields.\n",
    "**Influence on Scoring Hits:** When scoring hits for the recommender system, papers that span multiple common categories may receive a higher score, as they resonate with more popular themes. This could lead to an overrepresentation of interdisciplinary papers in recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Top 20 Primary Categories with \"cs.CV\" Papers Bar Plot: The plot indicates that 'cs.LG' and 'cs.AI' (Artificial Intelligence) are the next most frequent categories associated with 'cs.CV' papers.\n",
    "**Bias Mitigation:** To decrease bias, the recommender system could employ a normalization technique that accounts for the prevalence of terms. For example, a rarer label could be given more weight in the scoring function, to ensure that papers from less common categories are not overshadowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Pareto Plot of Primary Categories: The plot demonstrates a Pareto distribution, where a small number of categories account for a large proportion of papers. This indicates that a minority of labels are very common, while the majority are rare.\n",
    "**Reducing Bias:** The recommender system could be designed to promote diversity in recommendations by including less common labels in the results. This can be achieved by adjusting the ranking algorithm to increase the visibility of papers from underrepresented categories."

    "### Explanation of the Recommender System Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the vast expanse of academic literature, particularly in extensive repositories such as arXiv, pinpointing pertinent research papers is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. The recommender system under scrutiny employs an approach to navigate through this high-dimensional haystack to recommend papers that resonate with the semantic content of a user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system's crux lies in its ability to discern semantic similarity, a feat achieved by representing papers as points in a vector space modeled after their content. This vector space is not just any Euclidean space but one sculpted by the intricate semantics of academic discourse. The mathematical structure of this space is underpinned by embeddings generated from a Sentence Transformer, a neural model adept at capturing the essence of textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the entire corpus of papers as $\\mathcal{P}$ and a user's query by $q$. Each paper $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$ and the query $q$ are transmuted into high-dimensional vectors, $\\mathbf{v}_p$ and $\\mathbf{v}_q$ respectively, through a transformation $\\mathcal{T}$ orchestrated by the Sentence Transformer. Formally, this transformation is represented as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}: \\text{Text} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d$ is the dimensionality of the embeddings, and $\\text{Text}$ is the space of textual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the query and papers are embedded in this semantic space, their proximity is gauged using cosine similarity, a metric that measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, thus evaluating their directional alignment rather than magnitude. The cosine similarity between the query vector $\\mathbf{v}_q$ and a paper vector $\\mathbf{v}_p$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_q \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_p}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_q\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}_p\\|},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{v}_q$ and $\\mathbf{v}_p$. A cosine similarity close to 1 indicates a high degree of semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithmic Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon receiving the query $q$, the recommender system executes the following steps algorithmically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding the Query**: The query $q$ is encoded into its vector representation $\\mathbf{v}_q$.\n",
    "2. **Computing Similarities**: The cosine similarity between $\\mathbf{v}_q$ and every paper vector in the corpus is computed, forming a similarity vector $\\mathbf{s}$.\n",
    "3. **Ranking Papers**: Papers are ranked in descending order of their similarity to the query.\n",
    "4. **Selecting Top-k Papers**: The top $k$ papers are selected based on this ranking, ensuring the exclusion of the query paper if present in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Intra-cluster Ranking**: Within $C_q$, rank papers by their similarity to the centroid $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_q$ or another similarity metric.\n",

    "#### Implementing HDBSCAN with UMAP in a Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender system weaves together UMAP and HDBSCAN to provide precise and meaningful recommendations. The algorithm proceeds through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply UMAP to reduce the dimensions of the semantic embeddings, enhancing tractability and cluster distinction.\n",
    "2. **Density-based Clustering**: Perform HDBSCAN on the reduced embeddings to identify semantically dense clusters of papers.\n",
    "3. **Centroid Calculation**: Compute the centroids of the identified clusters in the reduced space to anchor the clusters.\n",
    "4. **Noise Integration**: Reassign noise points to the nearest clusters, incorporating a broader spectrum of papers.\n",
    "5. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Execute shallow hierarchical clustering on the centroids to discern broader categories within the academic discourse.\n",
    "6. **Label Mapping**: Map the hierarchical labels back to the original papers, preserving the high-level structure.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of models for semantic clustering of arXiv papers, including a basic recommender system, KMeans, HDBSCAN, and HDBSCAN with UMAP, was rigorously conducted using normalized scores and a suite of statistical tests without true labels. KMeans clustering demonstrated the highest performance, attributed to its effective handling of high-dimensional data and capability to group semantically similar papers, which facilitated relevant recommendations. The integration of UMAP with HDBSCAN followed closely, highlighting the benefits of dimensionality reduction in enhancing cluster quality by preserving data's local and global structure. However, it slightly lagged behind KMeans, suggesting a trade-off between complexity and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic recommender, relying on embedding-based similarity, provided strong baseline results, underscoring the value of semantic embeddings in capturing paper content. Conversely, HDBSCAN alone showed the lowest performance, indicating the necessity of dimensionality reduction or hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal clustering outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analyses, including MAE, Euclidean Distance, Spearman Correlation, T-tests, Mann-Whitney, Friedman, Nemenyi, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, alongside RBO scores and Kendall’s Tau, offered comprehensive insights into model comparisons. These tests were crucial for understanding the statistical significance of performance differences and models' rank-ordering capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation process highlighted the importance of model selection and optimization in unsupervised learning scenarios, especially in the absence of true labels. It underscored the need for careful hyperparameter tuning and the potential of combining clustering techniques with dimensionality reduction methods like UMAP to improve semantic clustering. Ultimately, KMeans emerged as the most effective model based on its superior normalized score and statistical test outcomes, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency in semantic paper recommendation tasks."
